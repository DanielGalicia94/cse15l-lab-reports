# Hello there
## Welcome back to my Lab Reports 

Today I am presenting the second report which will cover the following:
1. Creating a Webserver that can update
2. Debugging 101
3. Somethings that I learned from lab 2 and lab 3

So without any further ado:

Fortunately there is code for a web server in Lab 2 so, time to commandeer some code.
