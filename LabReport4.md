# Hello there
## Welcome back to my fourth lab report 

We are going to today the exact keystrokes to do the following 

1. Log into ieng6
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)


> This is probably the most time consuming and tedious thing Iâ€™ll have to do right now but it is what it is.

Anyways here is the meme of the day:

## Step 1: Log into ieng6

Since I had already logged in the ing6 before because it was acting kind of weird I ended up doing the following

```<up><enter> ```

Since my log in command was up once in my history of my terminal I simply hit the up key and enter to log in once again, Which, inturn leads me to to this point in my terminal.
