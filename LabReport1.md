## Instaling the VS Code 

First of all you need to install the VS code programm on your computer, so follow this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Depending on your computer type you will click the button but in the end just follow along everything and don't worry about the other settings, just use the default settings and in the end when the program instals you will find yourself with an image such as this.

 > For me I had already installed this thats why my screen looks a bit more different from what a brand new program looks like

With that you are done with the first step, unfortunatly this is where things get overly complicated so pay attention

## Remote connecting 

Here comes the likely the most complicated part remote connecting, first we have getting your id for your email that will loke like this:
cs15lsp23**@ieng6.ucsd.edu, the ** will be replaced with your ID but moving on.
> You can get your specific ID by using the following [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
 
After there is another step for us windows users downloading git bash wich can be done at this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/)
After donloading that we can finally open it on vscode and open a terminal using Ctrl+Shift+` or using the terminal menu in vscode the en result is this
